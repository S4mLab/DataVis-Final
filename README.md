# DataVis-Final
Repository for Data Visualisation Final Project

Hello Guys, 

This is the repo for our final project
All the code of the visualisation will go in there
if you want to want to update or modify the code directly to the project, you can folk this repo, write the code and update it with git
if you are not familiar with Git and Github, the video I sent you before may become handy 

Or you can just tell me directly how we should implement the code and I will do it ;) take it easy, no need to stress ;)

Cheer guys
